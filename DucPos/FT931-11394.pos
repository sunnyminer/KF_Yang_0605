The/DT president/NN said/VBD he/PRP would/MD focus/VB on/IN better/JJR implementation/NN of/IN the/DT Family/NNP Support/NN Act/NN ,/, a/DT 1988/CD welfare/NN reform/NN based/VBN on/IN the/DT work/NN of/IN an/DT NGA/NNP task-force/NN which/WDT he/PRP ,/, as/IN governor/NN of/IN Arkansas/NNP ,/, co-chaired/JJ ./. `/`` The/DT bill/NN that/WDT is/VBZ on/IN the/DT books/NNS will/MD work/VB ,/, given/VBN the/DT right/NN economy/NN and/CC the/DT right/JJ support/NN systems/NNS ,/, '/'' Mr/NNP Clinton/NNP said/VBD ./. Advocates/NNS of/IN welfare/NN reform/NN had/VBD been/VBN discouraged/VBN about/IN the/DT new/JJ administration/NN 's/POS intentions/NNS ,/, fearing/VBG that/IN the/DT centrist/JJ Democratic/JJ emphasis/NN on/IN requiring/VBG welfare/NN recipients/NNS to/TO work/VB or/CC enroll/VB for/IN training/NN might/MD fall/VB prey/NN to/TO left-wing/JJ advocacy/NN groups/NNS concentrating/VBG on/IN greater/JJR funding/NN of/IN existing/VBG programs/NNS ./.
