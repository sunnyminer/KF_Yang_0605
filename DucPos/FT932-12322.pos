In/IN congressional/JJ testimony/NN this/DT week/NN ,/, Mr/NNP Lloyd/NNP Bentsen/NNP ,/, US/NNP treasury/NN secretary/NN ,/, said/VBD the/DT US/NNP wanted/VBD to/TO see/VB more/JJR funding/NN that/IN `/`` will/MD create/VB social/JJ and/CC economic/JJ safety/NN nets/NNS '/POS for/IN poor/JJ people/NNS most/RBS affected/VBN by/IN war/NN ,/, civil/JJ strife/NN and/CC economic/JJ mismanagement/NN ./. `/`` We/PRP will/MD look/VB for/IN specific/JJ increases/NNS in/IN the/DT share/NN of/IN lending/NN going/VBG for/IN these/DT purposes/NNS ./. '/'' In/IN fiscal/JJ 1992/CD ,/, nearly/RB half/NN of/IN all/DT World/NNP Bank/NNP adjustment/NN loans/NNS failed/VBD to/TO include/VBP specific/JJ poverty/NN reduction/NN measures/NNS ,/, in/IN spite/NN of/IN calls/NNS from/IN Mr/NNP Preston/NNP to/TO put/VB greater/JJR emphasis/NN on/IN poverty/NN relief/NN ./. The/DT share/NN of/IN bank/NN lending/NN allocated/VBD for/IN `/`` human/JJ resource/NN development/NN '/'' is/VBZ still/RB only/RB 14/CD per/IN cent/NN ,/, in/IN spite/NN of/IN repeated/VBN calls/NNS from/IN Mr/NNP Preston/NNP for/IN an/DT increased/VBN emphasis/NN on/IN investment/NN in/IN people/NNS ./. At/IN a/DT news/NN conference/NN Mr/NNP Preston/NNP said/VBD the/DT bank/NN was/VBD making/VBG progress/NN :/: a/DT decade/NN ago/IN only/RB 5/CD per/IN cent/NN of/IN bank/NN lending/NN went/VBD for/IN human/JJ resource/NN development/NN and/CC only/RB 5/CD per/IN cent/NN of/IN structural/JJ adjustment/NN loans/NNS had/VBD a/DT explicit/JJ focus/NN on/IN poverty/NN ./. But/CC he/PRP said/VBD the/DT bank/NN had/VBD a/DT `/`` long/JJ ,/, long/JJ way/NN to/TO go/VB '/'' ./. While/IN he/PRP expected/VBD an/DT increase/NN in/IN the/DT share/NN of/IN bank/NN lending/NN aimed/VBN at/IN poverty/NN relief/NN ,/, he/PRP declined/VBD to/TO set/VB precise/JJ targets/NNS for/IN bank/NN staff/NN ./. Mr/NNP Preston/NNP ,/, however/RB ,/, does/VBZ intend/VB to/TO take/VB several/JJ new/JJ steps/NNS to/TO sharpen/VB the/DT bank/NN 's/POS focus/NN on/IN poverty/NN ./.
