President/NNP Bill/NNP Clinton/NNP 's/POS pledge/NN to/TO `/`` end/VB welfare/NN as/IN we/PRP know/VBP it/PRP '/'' was/VBD one/CD of/IN the/DT most/RBS popular/JJ lines/NNS in/IN last/JJ year/NN 's/POS election/NN campaign/NN ./. His/PRP$ idea/NN of/IN a/DT strict/JJ two-year/JJ time/NN limit/NN on/IN welfare/NN cheques/NNS appealed/VBD to/TO voters/NNS -LRB-/-LRB- especially/RB `/`` Reagan/NNP democrats/NNS '/POS -RRB-/-RRB- not/RB just/RB as/IN a/DT way/NN of/IN cutting/VBG government/NN spending/NN and/CC thus/RB reducing/VBG taxes/NNS ,/, but/CC as/IN a/DT solution/NN to/TO the/DT nation/NN 's/POS most/JJS pressing/VBG social/JJ problems/NNS ./. In/IN the/DT American/JJ mind/NN ,/, welfare/NN has/VBZ become/VBN synonymous/JJ with/IN such/JJ evils/NNS as/IN urban/JJ decay/NN ,/, fatherless/JJ children/NNS ,/, drug/NN abuse/NN and/CC violent/JJ crime/NN ./. By/IN promising/VBG radical/JJ welfare/NN reform/NN ,/, Mr/NNP Clinton/NNP was/VBD sending/VBG a/DT powerful/JJ subliminal/JJ message/NN :/: he/PRP would/MD wage/VB war/NN on/IN all/DT the/DT diseases/NNS that/WDT are/VBP ravaging/VBG urban/JJ society/NN ./. Since/IN becoming/VBG president/NN ,/, Mr/NNP Clinton/NNP has/VBZ barely/RB mentioned/VBN the/DT word/NN welfare/NN ,/, raising/VBG fears/NNS that/IN his/PRP$ grandiose/JJ promise/NN will/MD prove/VB as/RB cynical/JJ as/IN former/JJ President/NNP George/NNP Bush/NNP 's/POS `/`` read/VB my/PRP$ lips/NNS :/: no/DT new/JJ taxes/NNS '/POS pledge/NN ./. The/DT White/NNP House/NNP insists/VBZ that/IN welfare/NN reform/NN is/VBZ not/RB forgotten/VBN but/CC has/VBZ just/RB had/VBD to/TO take/VB its/PRP$ turn/NN behind/IN two/CD even/RB more/RBR urgent/JJ priorities/NNS :/: the/DT deficit/NN reduction/NN plan/NN finally/RB approved/VBN this/DT month/NN and/CC the/DT healthcare/NN reform/NN scheduled/VBN for/IN September/NNP ./. It/PRP claims/VBZ both/DT measures/NNS will/MD help/VB shift/VB people/NNS off/IN welfare/NN by/IN `/`` making/VBG work/NN pay/NN ./. '/'' The/DT budget/NN advanced/VBD this/DT cause/NN by/IN expanding/VBG the/DT earned/VBN income/NN tax/NN credit/NN -LRB-/-LRB- a/DT kind/NN of/IN negative/JJ income/NN tax/NN -RRB-/-RRB- ./. This/DT gives/VBZ poor/JJ working/VBG families/NNS a/DT cash/NN bonus/NN of/IN up/IN to/TO Dollars/NNPS 2,500/CD a/DT year/NN ,/, increasing/VBG the/DT incentive/NN to/TO take/VB low/JJ paid/VBN jobs/NNS ./. If/IN healthcare/NN reform/NN guarantees/VBZ health/NN insurance/NN for/IN all/DT workers/NNS ,/, welfare/NN recipients/NNS will/MD no/RB longer/RBR be/VB able/JJ to/TO reject/VB jobs/NNS on/IN the/DT grounds/NNS that/WDT they/PRP stand/VBP to/TO lose/VB their/PRP$ health/NN care/NN benefits/NNS ./. In/IN addition/NN ,/, the/DT administration/NN promises/VBZ to/TO bolster/VB the/DT economic/JJ position/NN of/IN welfare/NN mothers/NNS by/IN strictly/RB enforcing/VBG laws/NNS requiring/VBG absent/JJ fathers/NNS to/TO support/NN their/PRP$ children/NNS financially/RB ./. Such/JJ measures/NNS should/MD help/VB ./. But/CC they/PRP are/VBP hardly/RB going/VBG to/TO solve/VB America/NNP 's/POS welfare/NN problem/NN ,/, which/WDT differs/VBZ substantially/RB from/IN that/DT in/IN Europe/NNP ./. In/IN keeping/VBG with/IN Franklin/NNP Roosevelt/NNP 's/POS dictum/NN that/IN a/DT permanent/JJ dole/VB is/VBZ '/'' a/DT narcotic/JJ ,/, a/DT subtle/JJ destroyer/NN of/IN the/DT human/JJ spirit/NN '/'' ,/, the/DT US/NNP has/VBZ never/RB provided/VBN permanent/JJ welfare/NN support/NN for/IN single/JJ ,/, able-bodied/JJ adults/NNS ./. When/WRB pundits/NNS talk/VBP of/IN a/DT `/`` culture/NN of/IN welfare/NN '/'' they/PRP are/VBP referring/VBG mainly/RB to/TO the/DT Dollars/NNPS 20bn/JJ spent/VBN on/IN Aid/NN for/IN Families/NNS with/IN Dependent/NNP Children/NNP ,/, a/DT benefit/NN received/VBN by/IN 5m/CD single-parent/JJ families/NNS ./. The/DT objection/NN is/VBZ not/RB that/IN some/DT families/NNS in/IN straitened/JJ circumstances/NNS need/VBP AFDC/NNP as/IN a/DT short-term/NN prop/VB ,/, but/CC that/IN half/DT of/IN those/DT on/IN welfare/NN behave/VBP as/IN though/IN they/PRP have/VBP a/DT meal/NN ticket/NN for/IN life/NN ./. So/RB what/WP should/MD Mr/NNP Clinton/NNP do/VB ?/. Many/JJ conservatives/NNS favor/VBP the/DT concept/NN of/IN a/DT strict/JJ time/NN limit/NN ./. Once/RB people/NNS accept/VB that/DT benefits/NNS are/VBP not/RB going/VBG to/TO be/VB paid/VBN indefinitely/RB ,/, they/PRP argue/VBP ,/, behavior/NN will/MD change/VB ./. Teenagers/NNS will/MD stop/VB having/VBG babies/NNS and/CC start/VB recognizing/VBG the/DT economic/JJ advantages/NNS of/IN marriage/NN ./. Those/DT whose/WP$ welfare/NN benefits/NNS expire/VBP will/MD face/VB a/DT stark/JJ choice/NN :/: accept/VB low-paid/JJ employment/NN or/CC hand/NN over/IN children/NNS for/IN adoption/NN ./. At/IN first/JJ the/DT adjustment/NN will/MD be/VB horribly/RB painful/JJ but/CC in/IN the/DT longer/JJR term/NN society/NN will/MD gain/VB enormously/RB because/IN destructive/JJ lifestyles/NNS will/MD no/RB longer/RBR be/VB underwritten/VBN ./. With/IN its/PRP$ economic/JJ life/NN support/NN system/NN -LRB-/-LRB- welfare/NN -RRB-/-RRB- ripped/VBD away/RP ,/, the/DT underclass/NN will/MD shrivel/VB ./. But/CC no/DT modern/JJ president/NN would/MD contemplate/VB so/RB brutal/JJ a/DT social/JJ experiment/NN ./. If/IN welfare/NN stops/NNS ,/, something/NN has/VBZ to/TO take/VB its/PRP$ place/NN ./. One/CD suggestion/NN is/VBZ that/IN Mr/NNP Clinton/NNP should/MD follow/VB the/DT example/NN of/IN Roosevelt/NNP 's/POS Works/NNP Progress/NNP Administration/NNP ,/, an/DT agency/NN that/WDT at/IN its/PRP$ peak/NN created/VBD over/IN 3m/CD public/NN sector/NN jobs/NNS ./. After/IN two/CD years/NNS ,/, welfare/NN cheques/NNS would/MD thus/RB be/VB replaced/VBN by/IN the/DT offer/NN of/IN a/DT government/NN job/NN at/IN slightly/RB below/IN the/DT private/JJ sector/NN minimum/NN wage/NN ./. Mothers/NNP with/IN young/JJ children/NNS would/MD also/RB be/VB offered/VBN state/NN child/NN care/NN facilities/NNS ./. According/VBG to/TO one/CD advocate/NN ,/, this/DT would/MD amount/VB to/TO replacing/VBG the/DT welfare/NN state/NN by/IN the/DT `/`` work/NN ethic/JJ state/NN '/'' ./. This/DT solution/NN is/VBZ more/RBR appealing/JJ than/IN a/DT mere/JJ cessation/NN of/IN benefits/NNS ./. But/CC it/PRP would/MD involve/VB a/DT huge/JJ expansion/NN of/IN public/JJ sector/NN employment/NN and/CC cost/NN perhaps/RB Dollars/NNS 50-60bn/JJ a/DT year/NN ,/, far/RB more/RBR than/IN the/DT Clinton/NNP administration/NN is/VBZ willing/JJ to/TO spend/VB on/IN welfare/NN reform/NN ./. Fortunately/RB there/EX is/VBZ a/DT fall/NN back/RB position/NN for/IN Mr/NNP Clinton/NNP :/: the/DT bipartisan/JJ Family/NNP Support/NN Act/NN of/IN 1988/CD ,/, which/WDT he/PRP helped/VBD steer/VB through/IN Congress/NNP ./. This/DT recognized/VBN the/DT impossibility/NN of/IN ending/VBG welfare/NN overnight/RB and/CC instead/RB set/VBN targets/NNS for/IN the/DT gradual/JJ introduction/NN of/IN `/`` workfare/NN '/'' ./. Next/JJ year/NN states/NNS will/MD receive/VB federal/JJ assistance/NN only/RB if/IN they/PRP ensure/VBP that/IN at/IN least/JJS 15/CD per/IN cent/NN of/IN the/DT 'em/PRP ployable/JJ '/'' welfare/NN case/NN load/NN is/VBZ working/VBG or/CC in/IN training/NN programs/NNS ;/: by/IN 1995/CD the/DT required/VBN ratio/NN rises/NNS to/TO 20/CD per/IN cent/NN ./. These/DT seemingly/RB undemanding/JJ targets/NNS require/VBP a/DT much/JJ larger/JJR fraction/NN of/IN the/DT welfare/NN population/NN to/TO take/VB jobs/NNS at/IN some/DT point/NN during/IN the/DT year/NN ./. Mr/NNP Clinton/NNP could/MD tighten/VB the/DT definition/NN of/IN 'em/PRP ployable/VBP '/'' ,/, so/RB as/IN to/TO include/VB mothers/NNS with/IN children/NNS under/IN the/DT age/NN of/IN three/CD ,/, and/CC set/VBD more/RBR demanding/VBG workfare/NN participation/NN targets/NNS ,/, for/IN example/NN that/IN 50/CD per/IN cent/NN of/IN welfare/NN recipients/NNS should/MD be/VB working/VBG or/CC in/IN training/NN by/IN the/DT year/NN 2000/CD ./. Such/JJ a/DT gradualist/NN approach/NN would/MD be/VB both/DT humane/NN and/CC cost/NN effective/JJ ./. The/DT only/JJ trouble/NN is/VBZ that/IN it/PRP falls/VBZ far/RB short/JJ of/IN the/DT presidential/JJ promise/NN to/TO `/`` end/VB welfare/NN as/IN we/PRP know/VBP it/PRP '/'' ./.
