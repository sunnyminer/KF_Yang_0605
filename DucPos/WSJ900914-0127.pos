Based/VBN on/IN the/DT new/JJ findings/NNS ,/, Mr./NNP Gray/NNP predicted/VBD earlier/RBR this/DT summer/NN that/IN the/DT 1990/CD tropical/JJ storm/NN season/NN would/MD be/VB above/IN average/NN ,/, and/CC so/RB far/RB he/PRP seems/VBZ to/TO be/VB right/JJ ./.

A/DT sharp/JJ decrease/NN in/IN hurricane/NN activity/NN over/IN the/DT past/NN two/CD decades/NNS spurred/VBD business/NN and/CC residential/JJ development/NN that/IN would/MD be/VB vulnerable/JJ to/TO increased/VBN hurricane/NN activity/NN ./.
