Another/DT argument/NN is/VBZ that/IN a/DT citizen/NN Congress/NNP with/IN its/PRP$ continuing/VBG flow/NN of/IN fresh/JJ faces/NNS into/IN Washington/NNP would/MD result/VB in/IN better/JJR government/NN than/IN that/DT provided/VBN by/IN representatives/NNS with/IN lengthy/JJ tenure/NN ./.

A/DT problem/NN with/IN term/NN limits/NNS is/VBZ that/IN it/PRP creates/VBZ more/RBR lame/JJ ducks/NNS ,/, who/WP are/VBP less/JJR responsive/JJ to/TO the/DT desires/NNS of/IN the/DT electorate/NN ./.
