There/EX were/VBD no/DT immediate/JJ reports/NNS of/IN injury/NN or/CC damage/NN ./. Major/NNP earthquakes/NNS in/IN the/DT Solomons/NNPS usually/RB do/VBP n't/RB cause/VB much/JJ damage/NN or/CC many/JJ casualties/NNS because/IN the/DT area/NN is/VBZ sparsely/RB populated/VBN and/CC not/RB extensively/RB developed/VBN ./.

Saturday/NNP 's/POS earthquake/NN was/VBD the/DT strongest/JJS in/IN the/DT world/NN in/IN five/CD months/NNS ,/, Finley/NNP said/VBD ./.

The/DT survey/NN 's/POS earthquake/NN monitors/NNS in/IN Golden/NNP ,/, Colo./NNP ,/, said/VBD early/JJ seismograph/JJ readings/NNS placed/VBD the/DT epicenter/NN of/IN Saturday/NNP 's/POS earthquake/NN about/IN 200/CD miles/NNS southeast/NN of/IN Honiaria/NNP ,/, which/WDT is/VBZ on/IN Guadacanal/NNP Island/NNP and/CC is/VBZ the/DT capital/NN of/IN the/DT Solomons/NNPS ./.

The/DT Richter/NNP scale/NN is/VBZ a/DT measure/NN of/IN ground/NN motion/NN as/IN recorded/VBN on/IN seismographs/NNS ./. Every/DT increase/NN of/IN one/CD number/NN means/VBZ a/DT tenfold/RB increase/NN in/IN magnitude/NN ./. Thus/RB a/DT reading/NN of/IN 7.5/CD reflects/VBZ an/DT earthquake/NN 10/CD times/NNS stronger/JJR than/IN one/CD of/IN 6.5/CD ./. An/DT earthquake/NN of/IN 3.5/CD on/IN the/DT Richter/NNP scale/NN can/MD cause/VB slight/JJ damage/NN in/IN the/DT local/JJ area/NN ,/, 4/CD moderate/JJ damage/NN ,/, 5/CD considerable/JJ damage/NN ,/, 6/CD severe/JJ damage/NN ./.
