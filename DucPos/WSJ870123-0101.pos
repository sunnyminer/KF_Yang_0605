In/IN his/PRP$ State/NN of/IN the/DT Union/NNP address/NN last/JJ January/NNP ,/, President/NNP Reagan/NNP announced/VBD that/IN welfare/NN reform/NN would/MD be/VB a/DT priority/NN of/IN his/PRP$ administration/NN in/IN its/PRP$ final/JJ three/CD years/NNS ./.

''/'' The/DT president/NN 's/POS convincing/NN message/NN raised/VBD hopes/NNS that/IN something/NN would/MD finally/RB be/VB done/VBN to/TO break/VB the/DT cycle/NN of/IN poverty/NN and/CC dependency/NN that/WDT afflicts/VBZ several/JJ million/CD welfare/NN families/NNS ./. Americans/NNPS have/VBP become/VBN increasingly/RB exasperated/VBN by/IN the/DT enormous/JJ amount/NN of/IN money/NN the/DT federal/JJ government/NN devotes/VBZ each/DT year/NN to/TO anti-poverty/JJ programs/NNS ,/, with/IN little/JJ apparent/JJ abatement/NN in/IN poverty/NN ./. The/DT president/NN correctly/RB sensed/VBD that/IN the/DT public/NN wants/VBZ reform/NN ./. If/IN the/DT president/NN lets/VBZ up/RP on/IN welfare/NN reform/NN ,/, he/PRP will/MD disappoint/VB those/DT whose/WP$ hopes/NNS he/PRP raised/VBD last/JJ January/NNP ,/, a/DT group/NN that/WDT surely/RB includes/VBZ many/JJ of/IN the/DT poor/JJ who/WP understand/VBP better/RBR than/IN any/DT politician/NN how/WRB deficient/JJ the/DT current/JJ system/NN is/VBZ ./. To/TO build/VB on/IN the/DT momentum/NN he/PRP created/VBD a/DT year/NN ago/IN ,/, the/DT president/NN must/MD make/VB plain/JJ his/PRP$ commitment/NN in/IN the/DT State/NNP of/IN the/DT Union/NNP message/NN next/IN Tuesday/NNP ./. To/TO pull/VB away/RB now/RB would/MD be/VB to/TO undercut/VB the/DT welfare-reform/JJ movement/NN just/RB as/IN it/PRP has/VBZ hit/VBN its/PRP$ stride/NN ./. The/DT president/NN ought/MD to/TO challenge/VB Congress/NNP to/TO respond/VB to/TO his/PRP$ initiatives/NNS ./. His/PRP$ Domestic/JJ Policy/NN Council/NN has/VBZ drafted/VBN a/DT blueprint/NN ./. It/PRP would/MD give/VB the/DT states/NNS wider/JJR latitude/NN to/TO experiment/NN with/IN welfare/NN programs/NNS ./. Many/JJ of/IN the/DT governors/NNS seem/VBP to/TO like/VB the/DT plan/NN ,/, as/IN they/PRP have/VBP already/RB unveiled/VBN their/PRP$ own/JJ proposals/NNS for/IN welfare/NN reform/NN ./. The/DT president/NN and/CC the/DT governors/NNS should/MD be/VB natural/JJ allies/NNS on/IN this/DT issue/NN ,/, and/CC the/DT chances/NNS of/IN success/NN would/MD be/VB enhanced/VBN if/IN they/PRP could/MD jointly/RB commit/VB themselves/PRP to/TO a/DT plan/NN of/IN action/NN ./. The/DT president/NN will/MD need/VB all/DT the/DT help/NN he/PRP can/MD get/VB if/IN he/PRP is/VBZ to/TO convince/VB Democrats/NNPS in/IN Congress/NNP to/TO go/VB along/RP ./.

This/DT past/NN December/NNP ,/, a/DT coalition/NN of/IN some/DT 80/CD organizations/NNS ,/, most/JJS with/IN headquarters/NNS in/IN Washington/NNP ,/, issued/VBD a/DT ``/`` statement/NN of/IN principles/NNS ''/'' calling/VBG for/IN increased/VBN spending/NN for/IN poverty/NN and/CC jobs/NNS programs/NNS ./. It/PRP also/RB insisted/VBD that/IN the/DT federal/JJ government/NN has/VBZ ``/`` primary/JJ responsibility/NN ''/'' for/IN operating/VBG welfare/NN ./. Congressional/JJ Democrats/NNPS seem/VBP to/TO be/VB in/IN agreement/NN with/IN the/DT welfare/NN lobby/NN ./. However/RB ,/, the/DT public/NN wants/VBZ the/DT system/NN changed/VBD ./.
